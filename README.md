# DeDroid
Name **De**obfuscation of An**Droid** apps.

## About
Many Android apps are minified by obfuscation tools like ProGuard and DexGuard, for example replacing meaningful identifiers into short meaningless symbols, which makes it difficult to understand the code directly.
DeDroid aims to recover the minified identifiers using machine learning.
